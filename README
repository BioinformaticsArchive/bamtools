Significant re-write of BamReader API as of 5/18/2009:
-------------------------------------------------------
No longer using bgzf.h/.c
No longer using libbambc.a library
No longer using STL Utilities
Minor changes to API syntax in opening BAM files with BamReader - see BamReader.h for details


Compile instructions
----------------------
Short version:
See Makefile for compilation example.

Longer version:
Copy BamAlignment.h, BamReader.* and/or BamWriter.* to working directory.
#include "BamReader.h" and/or "BamWriter.h"
Use standard compile commands, including the "-lz" parameter to access zlib functionality.
(Note that "-L. -lbambc" are no longer necessary and WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS for compiler/linker )


Feel free to email me or pop by my desk with any questions, comments, suggestions, etc.
