BamTools: a C++ API for reading/writing BAM files.

The API consists of 2 main modules - BamReader and BamWriter. As you would expect, 
BamReader provides read-access to BAM files, while BamWriter does the writing of BAM
files. BamReader provides an interface for random-access (jumping) in a BAM file.
 
An additional file, BamAux.h, is included as well.  
This file contains the common data structures and typedefs used throught the API.

------------------------------------------------------------

To use this API, you simply need to do 3 things:

    1 - Drop the BamTools files somewhere the compiler can find them.
	    (i.e. in source directory, or somewhere in include path)
	
	2 - Import BamTools API with the following lines of code
	    
	    #include "BamReader.h"     // as needed
		#include "BamWriter.h"     // as needed
	    using namespace BamTools;
		
	3 - Compile with '-lz' ('l' as in 'lion') to access ZLIB compression library

See any included programs and Makefile for more specific compiling/usage examples.
See documentation & comments in header files for API details.
